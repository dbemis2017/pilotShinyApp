# pilotShinyApp
### This app was designed based off of the template provided by: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/build.html

It was used to help judge differences between samples visually, with each sample having 3 points of data from 3 different assays

The sample and assay names have been blinded for confidentiality, as well as the data being proprietary to Seres Therapeutics
